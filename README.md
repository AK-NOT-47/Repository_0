Ther folder structur matters.
The basic folder structure is as such:
-Python Code
-Python Input
-Python In but Not Out
-Python Out

There are two files of code:
-Cleansing
-Unioning

Cleansing

This code takes excel files and exclude unwanted rows ( like some crap on top {ie; titles or descriptions}) and then seperates all the files by sheet and puts them into the 'Python In but Not Out' folder as csv files.

Union

This code takes csv files, looks at the headers and combines files according to the commonality of headers
